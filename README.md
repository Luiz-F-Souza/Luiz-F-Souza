# About me

## Why i've decided to study programming ?

#### So, i'm currently working as administrative assistant. By a year ago i've seen that there were a problem with the recepcionist and the people in labs.
#### Then i've decided to try to resolve that. After a lot of research i've seen that I could solve that by using JavaScript and AppScript. So the problem was solved and ive descovered that i love solve problems, specialy if that envolves programming.

## What am I'm doing to learn ?

#### I'm currently at the college of internet systems and making some courses at udemy. My wish is to get a job in this area as soon as possible, as I'm working all day (from 07am to 17:30pm) I got only a few hours to focus on programming (which its really sad).

## Personality:

#### I really appreciate team work, I think that with an environment of colaboration every thing turn more simple for every one, after all, every one has something to teach (and I know that I have a lot to learn form others).
